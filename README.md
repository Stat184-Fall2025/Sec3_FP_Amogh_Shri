# Project Title

Analyzing Stock Market Behavior Leading up to Major Recessions
## Overview
The project dives into whether stock market behavior shows consistent patterns in the months leading up to major U.S. recessions. Using financial data accessed through the {quantmod} package in R, we will explore trends, volatility shifts, and structural changes during key points in time. Our goal is to identify whether certain indicators can signal recessions and to see what we can predict in the market going forward.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

One of our earlier discoveries came from analyzing the normalized S&P500 trajectories in 2007, 2020, and 2025. Each series was normalized to 100 at the start point. This allows us to compare the market dynamics throughout crises. This allows us to better understand whether current trends match pre-recession circumstances.
