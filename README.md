# Project Title

Analyzing Stock Market Behavior Leading up to Major Recessions
## Overview
The project dives into whether stock market behavior shows consistent patterns in the months leading up to major U.S. recessions. Using financial data accessed through the {quantmod} package in R, we will explore trends, volatility shifts, and structural changes during key points in time. Our goal is to identify whether certain indicators can signal recessions and to see what we can predict in the market going forward.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

One of our earlier insights comes from comparing the normalized S&P500 trajectories across 2007,2020, and 2025.
We normalized each series to 100 at its starting point. By doing this, we can compare the shape of the market between the different crises.
This helps us contextualize whether current trends resemble past pre-recession environments.
